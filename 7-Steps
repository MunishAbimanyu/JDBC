JDBC:
	Jdbc Stands for Java DataBase Connectivity

	* Which is Used to Interactly Communicate Java Application to RDBMS Application
We Follow 7 Steps:
	1.)Loading Driver
	2.)Create the Connection
	3.)Issue the Query
	4.)Create the Statement
	5.)Execute the Query
	6.)Process the Query
	7.)Close the Statement

Loading The Driver:
	Loading the Driver We can Load by Using rt.jar File.

	Code:
		Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

	*forName of method is Used to Loading the Driver.
Create the Connection:
	*Create the Connection we can Create By using getConnection() Method. 
	*Which is Present in Java.sql.DriverManager class. 
	*In this method we can pass Url,UserName,PassWord.

	Code:
		Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,userName,passWord);

Issue the Query:

	In Query We have 4 types
	1.)Static Select type Query
	2.)static Other then Select Query
	3.)Dynamic type Query
	4.)Dynamic otherthen select type Query

i)Static Select Query:
	A Query Which is Starts in Select Query is Know as Select Query

ii)Other then Select Query:
	A Query Which is Satrts without Select Query is Known as Otherthan Select Query

iii)Dynamic select type Query:
	A Query Which is static select but which is contain placeholder is known as Dynamic Select type Query

iv)Dynamic Otherthan Select type Query:
	A Query which is start without select query but which is contain placeholder is known as Dynamic Otherthan Select type Query
Create Statement:

	In Statement we have 3 
	1)Statement
	2)PreparedStatement
	3)CallableStatement

i)Statement:

	*It is a Interface Which is Present in Java.sql.Statment
	*In Statement Interface we can create Statement by using createStatement() method.

	Code:
		Statement st = con.createStatement();
ii)PreparedStatement:

	*It is a Interface. Which is Present in java.sql.PreparedStatement
	*When ever Placeholder - ? present in the query then they can make use of preparedStatement
	*In preparedStatement Interface we can create Statement by using prepareStatement() method	

	Code:
		PreparedStatement pst = con.prepareStatement();

iii)CallableStatement

	*It is a CallableStatement.Which is Present in java.sql.CallableStatement
	*When ever we want pass and return value form the procedure then they can make 
use of CallableStatement.
	*In callable Statement we can call by Using prepareCall() method.

	Code:
	CallableStatement cst = con.prepareCall();
	
Execute the Query:

	1)executeQuery();
	2)executeUpdate();

i)Execute Query:
	*executeQuery method is inbuild method which is return ResultSet.
	*When ever we want to Hole Table then they can make use of Execute Query method.

ii)Execute Update:
	*ExecuteUpdate is a inbuild method which is return int value.
	*When ever we want to update and delete then they can make use of ExecuteUpdate method.

Process the Query:

	*We can process the Query by using get Method().

	code: 
		rs.getInt(1);

Close the Connection:
	*In make use of close() method we can close the Connection.
	*Without Close Connection we can Execute the Program.
